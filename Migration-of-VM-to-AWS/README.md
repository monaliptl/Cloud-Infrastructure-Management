## Migration of VM to AWS
Migrated a virtual machine to AWS EC2, configured the cloud environment and validated post-migration performance and connectivity.


## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Services Used

The following AWS services were used during the VM migration process:

- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì To upload and store the exported OVA file.
- **AWS CLI** ‚Äì To execute AWS commands from the terminal.
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** ‚Äì To create a role with trust policy for VM import.
- **VM Import/Export** ‚Äì To convert the OVA file into an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
- **Amazon EC2** ‚Äì To launch and run the virtual machine in the AWS cloud.
- **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** ‚Äì The OVA file was converted into an AMI to be used with EC2.

### Task 1: Run a VM on VMware Workstation using Windows 10 Pro ISO image

### Task4: Create AWS role for VM importing 
(command - aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document "file://C:\import\trust-policy.json" )
(aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document "file://C:\import\role-policy.json")

####  üîê IAM Trust Policy - allows AWS services to assume the role
 
```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": { "Service": "vmie.amazonaws.com" },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
               "sts:Externalid": "vmimport"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

####  üîê IAM Role Policy - defines what actions are allowed when the role is assumed

```json
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket" 
         ],
         "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::myvmupload1",
            "arn:aws:s3:::myvmupload1/*"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:GetBucketAcl"
         ],
         "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::myvmupload1",
            "arn:aws:s3:::myvmupload1/*"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
            "ec2:CopySnapshot",
            "ec2:RegisterImage",
            "ec2:Describe*"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Task6: Import the AMI 
(command - aws ec2 import-image --description "My server VM" --disk-containers "file://C:\import\containers.json")


####  üîê Import VM into AMI as a Disk Container
```json
[
  {
    "Description": "My Server VM",
    "Format": "ova",
    "UserBucket": {
        "S3Bucket": "myvmupload1",
        "S3Key": "My vm.ova"
    }
  }
]
```
